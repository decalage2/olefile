OleFileIO_PL module:

OleFileIO_PL is a Python module to read Microsoft OLE2 files (also called 
Structured Storage or Compound Document File Format), such as Microsoft Office 
documents, Image Composer and FlashPix files, Outlook messages, etc. 

This is an improved version of the OleFileIO module from PIL, the excellent 
Python Imaging Library v1.1.6, created and maintained by Fredrik Lundh. 
(See http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm)

The API is still compatible with PIL, but the internal implementation has been 
improved a lot, with bugfixes and a more robust design. As far as I know, this 
module is the most complete and robust Python implementation to read MS OLE2 
files, portable on several OSes.

WARNING: THIS IS (STILL) WORK IN PROGRESS.

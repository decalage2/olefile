<h1 id="olefileio_pl">OleFileIO_PL</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.decalage.info/python/olefileio">OleFileIO_PL</a> is a Python module to read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_File_Binary_Format">Microsoft OLE2 files (also called Structured Storage, Compound File Binary Format or Compound Document File Format)</a>, such as Microsoft Office documents, Image Composer and FlashPix files, Outlook messages, ...</p>
<p>This is an improved version of the OleFileIO module from <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm">PIL</a>, the excellent Python Imaging Library, created and maintained by Fredrik Lundh. The API is still compatible with PIL, but I have improved the internal implementation significantly, with new features, bugfixes and a more robust design.</p>
<p>As far as I know, this module is now the most complete and robust Python implementation to read MS OLE2 files, portable on several operating systems. (please tell me if you know other similar Python modules)</p>
<p>WARNING: THIS IS (STILL) WORK IN PROGRESS.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-this-module">How to use this module:</h2>
<p>See sample code at the end of the module, and also docstrings.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<pre><code>:::python
    import OleFileIO_PL

    # Test if a file is an OLE container:
    assert OleFileIO_PL.isOleFile(&#39;myfile.doc&#39;)

    # Open an OLE file from disk:
    ole = OleFileIO_PL.OleFileIO(&#39;myfile.doc&#39;)

    # Get list of streams:
    print ole.listdir()

    # Test if known streams/storages exist:
    if ole.exists(&#39;worddocument&#39;):
        print &quot;This is a Word document.&quot;
        print &quot;size :&quot;, ole.get_size(&#39;worddocument&#39;)
        if ole.exists(&#39;macros/vba&#39;):
             print &quot;This document seems to contain VBA macros.&quot;

    # Extract the &quot;Pictures&quot; stream from a PPT file:
    if ole.exists(&#39;Pictures&#39;):
        pics = ole.openstream(&#39;Pictures&#39;)
        data = pics.read()
        f = open(&#39;Pictures.bin&#39;, &#39;w&#39;)
        f.write(data)
        f.close()

    # Extract metadata (new in v0.24) - see source code for all attributes:
    meta = ole.get_metadata()
    print &#39;Author:&#39;, meta.author
    print &#39;Title:&#39;, meta.title
    print &#39;Creation date:&#39;, meta.create_time
    # print all metadata:
    meta.dump()

    # Close the OLE file:
    ole.close()

    # Work with a file-like object (e.g. StringIO) instead of a file on disk:
    data = open(&#39;myfile.doc&#39;, &#39;rb&#39;).read()
    f = StringIO.StringIO(data)
    ole = OleFileIO_PL.OleFileIO(f)
    print ole.listdir()
    ole.close()</code></pre>
<p>It can also be used as a script from the command-line to display the structure of an OLE file, for example:</p>
<pre><code>OleFileIO_PL.py myfile.doc</code></pre>
